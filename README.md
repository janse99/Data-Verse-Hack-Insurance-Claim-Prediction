# Data-Verse-Hack-Insurance-Claim-Prediction
Problem Statement- Predict whether the policyholder will file a claim in the next 6 months or not. The model which results the best accuracy in my case is CatBoost
CarIns is a startup that provides insurance for cars. It is one of the best car insurance brands known for the highest claim settlement ratio. It was launched back in Oct 2020 and acquired its initial policyholders by providing a hassle-free claim process, instant policy issuance, and claim settlements at minimum coverages.

As it's a fast growing startup, the company would like to optimize the cost of the insurance by identifying the policyholders who are more likely to claim in the next 6 months. 

Now the company would like to use Data Science to identify the policyholders whose chances of filing a claim are high in the next 6 months. The company challenges the Data Science community to build a high-performance algorithm to predict if the policyholder will file a claim in the next 6 months or not based on the set of car and policy features.

# Steps which i follow to solve this hackathaon.
# Step-1: Understand the Data( By doing Univariate and Bi-variate Analysis)
# Step-2: Datapreprocessing(like Feature Engineering,Encoding,Scalling and Transformation)
# Step-3: Build the Base Model
# Step-4: As the Target class is imbalanced so apply Oversampling Smote technique to make it balance
# Step-5: Fit the Model on the oversampling data,i can see that their is drastically improvement in the performance of this model
# Step-6: Build Diffrent kinds of models and compare it with each other
# Step-7: Finaaly choose the top 3 and fit the final Model
# Step-8: Model Catboost will give the Highest Accuracy finally.
